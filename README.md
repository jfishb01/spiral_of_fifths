Spiral of Fifths
===========

The Spiral of Fifths is an instrument originally developed by Ruben Dax, Andrew Whitehead, and I as part of the Tufts University Electronic Music Instrument Design course. This instrument was built entirely from scratch - we did everything including conceptualizing the instrument, drafting it in AutoCAD, manufacturing and laser cutting the frame, wiring and soldering electrical components, programming the instrument, and creating new sound patches.

Ruben and I have been continuing to make developments for the instrument post graduation. One such development was moving the instrument playing logic and MIDI conversion from Max/MSP directly to the Arduino itself. This allows it to be an entirely self contained unit that does not depend on additional third party software to play.

Here are some videos of Ruben explaining and playing around on the instrument.
